The first one is that the planet, the environment and life in general needs of all those efforts, little ones or big ones like this one, in order to fight all the climate and wastes issues and the second thing is they have clear that data is a great ally in this fight, that's is why is tracking the recycling behaviors of the different neighborhoods on the city.",

They know that recycling is not that hard and benefits everyone. They give all kinds of guides to decide what goes in the green tote, what in the blue and what to drop off, also an explaining of the city's laws for refusing and recycling collection is provided. Here is a report of Buffalo of recycling on 2018: <a href=\"https://buffalorecycles.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/2018-Annual-Recycling-Report.pdf\">2018 Annual Recycling Report</a>. ",

In the dashboard we have the phenomenon shaped by the diversion rate of recycling, what neighborhoods have the highest and lowest rate and a map of the distribution also the plot of a time series can be seen on the dashboard. This is very helpful to understand how is behaving the phenomenon and lead us to the right strategies to enhance the initiative which I repeat is very important and useful for everyone.",

For this project the main objective is to find all the insights mentioned on this last section in order to help the great initiative that the Buffalo City has.",
